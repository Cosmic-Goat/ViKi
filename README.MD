# ViKi
ViKi is an affordable medical device designed to address the issues with people not seeking the healthcare they need due to finacial and oppurtunity costs.

### Skunkworks Medical Device Challenge
This is our team's code for NYU Patent Pending Club's Spring 2022 Skunkworks hackathon.

### Website
A preview demo of the static site that a patient or doctor would find when plugging ViKi into their computer can be seen [here](https://cosmic-goat.github.io/ViKi/).
